#Chapter 20: Finding Help (apropos, HELP)

##Do This

$ apropos directory
```
This command is used to help you find the command you should use for a function you know of. Although this is
rarely used, it can be used as a last ditch effort if you don't have wifi..As searching the internet for the answer is easier and faster.
