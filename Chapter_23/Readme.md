#Chapter 23: Exiting Your Terminal (exit)

##Do More

###For your last set of exercises I'm going to have you use the help system to look up a set of commands you should research and learn how to use on your own.

###xargs
Execute arguments. Often it is used in conjunction with a pipe operator. Whereas many commands cannot execute long lists of arguments without crashing, xargs splits lists into sublists and then executes the command on to sublists.

###sudo
super user do. Allows the user to run certain commands as the "super user" or any other user. It is used to bypass certain restrictions placed onto the current user.

###chmod
change modifier permissions. Allows the user to change the read/write/execute permissions of a file.

###chown
change owner. Allows the user to change the owner or group of a file. This can possibly lead to more file permissions going to a certain user/group if they didn't have them previously.

##English Questions

###Can you reload your terminal?

I can exit my current session my typing `exit`, then reload by double clicking iterm2 in my dock or by searching for it in spotlight or finder.

###Can you logout?

Yes, I just use the command `exit`
